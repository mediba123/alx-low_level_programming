# README

This repository contains projects completed as part of the low-level programming and algorithm curriculum at [ALX-africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/). Each project focuses on different concepts in programming, such as debugging, functions, pointers, and more.

## Projects

### 0x00-hello_world

This project focuses on the basics of the C programming language, including printing to standard output, compiling source code, and using header files.

### 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This project focuses on variable declaration, conditional statements, and loops in C.

### 0x02-functions_nested_loops

This project focuses on functions and nested loops in C, including function prototypes, header files, and how to use nested loops.

### 0x03-debugging

This project focuses on debugging skills in C, including how to read and interpret error messages and how to use tools like gdb and valgrind.

### 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

This project continues to build on skills learned in 0x02-functions_nested_loops, with a focus on more advanced topics such as recursion, static variables, and the use of header files.

### 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

This project focuses on pointers, arrays, and strings in C, including how to manipulate them and how to use them in function arguments and return values.

### 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

This project continues to build on skills learned in 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings, with a focus on more advanced topics such as multidimensional arrays, command-line arguments, and the use of pointers to pointers.
